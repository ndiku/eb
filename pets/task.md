Part 2 Create a view that lists all pets in the database. The list should
display the name and species of the pet, e.g., :

Alex (dog)

Bob (cat)

Carrie (hamster)

Create a view that allows users (who are not logged in) to add new pets to the
database. The view should provide a form that when submitted creates a pet. It
should enforce the model restrictions mentioned in part 1.

You can just zip the file and share it with me including part 1.
